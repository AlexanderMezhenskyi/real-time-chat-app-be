## ðŸ”§ Getting Started

To run the backend server locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   Run the following command in the root directory to install all libraries defined in `package.json`:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. **Start Development Server**  
   Launch the development server with hot-reloading:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   The backend will start on ([http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)) by default.


3. **Build the Project**  
   Transpile TypeScript code into JavaScript::

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

   The build output will be located in the `dist` directory.


4. **Start Production Server**  
   Run the compiled server:

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```
